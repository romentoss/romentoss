## About me

🖥️ I'm a full stack Web Developer from Spain (Canary Islands) 🌴🌴

🙇 I am currently in the process of improving to an expert level in the angular 📕 framework as front , on the other hand as back improving with the use of the NestJs 📙 framework, always prioritizing the use of typescript 📘 on both sides of development, and in turn learning about crm from salesforce ☁️.
